These are not very relevant and are related to this setting (itâ€™s not really conclusive to compare these with each other):

N = 6000
Blue: no sampling (6000))
Green:
sampling (1/3: 6000 from 18000)
Red: 
sampling (1/5: 6000 from 30000)

N = 10000
Cian: no sampling
Magnet: 
sampling (1/3: 10000 from 30000)
Yellow:
Sampling (1/5: 1000 from 50000)

Observation: the curve for 6000 from 30000 and 10000 from 30000 are the same  it depends how many data points initially we have
work with very small samples
